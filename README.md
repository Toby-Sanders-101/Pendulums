# Pendulums

This is a Python project that simulates pendulums, springs and masses. It doesn't work perfectly but it might work well enough to simulate Kapitza's pendulum. 
For this, a new class will be needed for a string that is always the same length but that's pretty much identical to the already existing string class.
And another class will be needed to create an oscillating pivot point.

The main file to execute is `simulation.py`. `object_cls.py` and `system_cls.py` also contain important code that often needs modifying.

Generally lots of things have strange names because the code is largely copied from antoher of my projects.

When I get some more time (after Schek's ODEs) I will add comments, clean up the code and try to create Kapitza's pendulum.
