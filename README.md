# Pendula

This is a Python project that simulates Kapitza's Pendulum. This is a set up where a mass is connected to an arm of fixed length, which is connected at the other end to a pivot point that oscillates quickly up and down.

For systems where the square of the product of the angular fequency of the oscillations of the pivot point ($\omega$) and the amplitude of the oscillations of the pivot point ($A$), is greater than two times the product of the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) and the length of the arm ($l$),...

$(\omega A)^2 > 2 g l$

...the effective potential of the mass has a minimum when it is vertically above (and below) the pivot. This means that the mass appears to swing as if gravity was acting upwards.
